<div><h3 id="hasnaa-fatehi-phd-economy">Hasnaa Fatehi, PhD, Economy</h3>
<p><img style="float:left; padding: 5px; margin: 10px;" width="200px" height="200px" src="/images/goldies/hasnaa.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: Moroccan with degrees in Science from France (Msc) and Germany (PhD), I was naturalized Canadian in late 2018.
I completed my PhD in 2009 in the midst of the financial crisis. There were no European work permits to be provided for North-Africans like me, even with a PhD in Science. I applied for the Singaporean program EPEC, a grad student friend of mine had pointed me to, and was approved after three weeks only. I left for Singapore where I started my Regulatory career at P&amp;G, it was an amazing experience! Ironically, when I was contemplating applying for the TW Gold Card, I read that it was designed after the Singaporean EPEC. This is the point at which I knew I would qualify if I applied. I am very glad to be back to Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: The Medtech industry is very dynamic here with incredible talent and innovation that needs exporting. The pro-democracy spirit here is also something unique in Asia. Everything is open to discussion and while the Taiwanese are grappling with their identity, they understand what it means to be a silenced minority, listen with genuine curiosity to other groups and don&rsquo;t shy away from contributing to the world. I find the overall energy to be hopeful, inspiring and motivating.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong>: Setting up a branch of my business in TW, building relationships particularly with local incubators and accelerator programs, seeking clients, and hopefully starting to make some money very very soon.</p>
<p>Staying in Taiwan was not in my plan. I was going to be here for six months, accompany my partner for his exchange, take Chinese lessons, study for a professional certification exam, and do lots of business intelligence here, in China and Singapore. When the Covid outbreak happened my partner and I weighed every week the pros and cons of staying vs. returning to BC. Quickly after that I understood that I had before me a business opportunity, being in the MedTech industry, I could not turn away from. Manufacturing sites were still running in TW, large MedTech MNCs were/are still talking about deglobalizing and moving some of the manufacturing outside of China and President Tsai making MedTech a high priority sector. It was clear Taiwan was the place to be for my business. This is how I ended up applying for the Gold Card.</p>

<p><img style="float:left; padding: 5px; margin: 10px;" width="200px" height="200px" src="/images/goldies/patrick-ng.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: I&rsquo;m originally from Hong Kong and grew up in the United States. I have a BA from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA and MPH from Boston University. My background is primarily in hospital administration, health policy research, and medical device startups. I am also involved in church and recently helped start <a href="http://www.thrivetaipei.com/">Thrive Church</a> that ministers to college students and young adults in Taipei.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: I used to visit Taiwan almost every year for the past decade on work-related trips and saw just how amazing this country is and how friendly the people are. When an opportunity opened up to help in a research and education initiative in Taipei, it seemed like a great fit so my family relocated from Boston a couple years ago. As I have spent more time in Taiwan, it further cemented the feeling that we made the right decision: 1) convenience - efficient public transportation system in Taipei, 7-elevens on every block, restaurants and grocery stores within easy reach, 2) social equality - universal health care coverage and civil liberties, 3) people - warm, friendly, and helpful, 4) safe, and 5) Costco - there are 5 in Taipei!</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I help run the <a href="http://www.newschooltaiwan.org/">New School for Leadership in Healthcare</a> which is located at the Koo Foundation Sun Yat-Sen Cancer Center. The New School is a two-year training program that takes mid-career professionals in healthcare fields (e.g. medicine, industry, government, academia) and teaches them to understand all aspects of health systems from understanding healthcare management, to improving healthcare quality, to imagining the future of healthcare. The goal is to ultimately train the next Minister of Health or the next leader of a health system, large or small, from community clinics to global institutes. We equip our scholars to manage healthcare crises and improve healthcare delivery, quality, and value.</p>
<p>I am a co-author on the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762689">JAMA paper</a> that raised Taiwan&rsquo;s profile to the international community for its excellent COVID-19 response: I continue to be on the lookout for interesting healthcare startups and folks who are thinking critically about health policy reform.</p>

<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: Taiwan was already a second home to me. The company I work with wanted to establish an Asia Area Office, and Taiwan was the perfect location from a geological, linguistic, and technological standpoint. The Gold Card was one additional benefit that Taiwan offered.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I am currently working for <a href="https://www.romariccorp.com/">Romaric Corp</a> as the Asia Area Manager.

<p><strong>Background</strong>: I am an expert in distributed systems (got my start in famous particle physics experiments) and used to manage one of the largest Open Source user communities in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: In a previous job, Taipei was the Asia-Pacific regional center. I was coming here a lot for conferences, built up a friendship network, got to know the daily life and had a strong feeling that I could live here. When I got a job where I could choose to live anywhere in the world, I moved and haven&rsquo;t looked back!</p>

<p><img style="float:left; padding: 5px; margin: 10px;" width="200px" height="200px" src="/images/goldies/zach.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Background</strong>: University of Michigan - B.S. Mechanical Engineering and Masters in Technology Commercialization</p>
<p><strong>Why Taiwan?</strong>: I wanted to learn Chinese which I realized was an important language in international business, particularly in China-Africa relations.
Additionally, I wanted a more drastic change-up from my regular life and job in America and do something a little crazier, like traveling and getting back into startups. The low cost of living and tech ecosystem in Taiwan was very attractive towards this dream.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I&rsquo;m currently teaching kids about technology at Skyrock Projects. We work on coding, robotics, and maker skills!</p>
<p>Within my 3 years of having the Gold Card visa, I want to establish an energy technology startup company, develop key resources and partners in Taiwan, and then commercialize the technology to Africa.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong>: Seasoned professional in software engineeringÂ from Ireland. I have a Bachelor&rsquo;s Degree in Computer Science from Ulster University. Worked on major systems within the aviation industry.</p>

Once approved I then relocated to Taiwan and have been happily living here since.</p>
<p><strong>What are you currently doing in Taiwan?</strong> I work for a company called <a href="https://www.tpisoftware.com/en/">TPIsoftware</a> primarily on financial software for the major banks.
