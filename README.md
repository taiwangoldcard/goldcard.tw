# [Taiwan Gold Card](https://taiwangoldcard.com/)

We are built with an open and transparency spirit. Everyone can contribute, and suggest/implement ideas

Our goal is to:

1. Increase the profile of the Gold Card, cementing its position as a 'special' accomplishment
2. Rally the pool of Gold Card Holders to improve the life of all foreign residents in Taiwan
3. Raise the profile of Taiwan as a great place to live and work, so new talents are attracted in Taiwan

## Website architecture

- Use https://gohugo.io (extended version) with the [compose theme](https://github.com/onweru/compose)
- Hosted on GitHub
- We use Cloudflare

## Working with the repo

### Setup the project

```bash
brew install hugo # check https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/ for alternative method
git clone https://github.com/taiwangoldcard/goldcard.tw.git
cd goldcard.tw
hugo server # launch a server and serve it at http://localhost:1313/
```

### Editing the content

`content` is where you should usually edit the content

### Editing the layout

- Content: `content/` -- Most copy should be edited here.
- HTML: `themes/compose/layout/` -- is where you want to modify the layout
- JS: `themes/compose/assets/js/` -- is where you want to modify or add new JS functionality
- CSS: `themes/compose/assets/sass/` -- is where is the styles are. `hugo` will automatically translates it to CSS

- Output: `docs/` is the "build" folder, where GitHub look at to show the [Taiwan Gold Card](https://taiwangoldcard.com/) website

### Tests

We have frontend tests (with cypress) to check if the website still works properly before being available on the website. All tests are ran automatically via [github workflows](./.github/workflows/tests.yml) when you push a commit. You can see them [here](https://dashboard.cypress.io/projects/rtyzr7/runs). Each test has a video attached to it.

If you need to run the tests locally:

1. First, install node / npm. This is required for the test executable. You may use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm):

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

2. At this repo's root, perform `npm install`. This will install `cypress`, the automated test runner.

3. Run the application `npm start`.

4. Run the tests `npm test`.

5. (Optional) To debug tests, you can `./node_modules/cypress/bin/cypress open` to view the interactive UI and select the tests to run:

### Deploy changes

When you push to master (or merge a Pull Request), a [github action workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) will be automatically called, and deploy your changes to the website.

You can see how it works in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
