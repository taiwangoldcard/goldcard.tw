      <description>What do I need to tell my employer about the Gold Card? Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply for a work permit or visa for you.
What happens if I lose my job? You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be affected by a change of job.</description>

      <description>What health insurance is available in Taiwan? All who are eligible for National Health Insurance must enrol in the program (your employer will do this for you), which provides comprehensive and inexpensive coverage. There are also a range of private health insurance options.
I&amp;rsquo;m a freelancer/I don&amp;rsquo;t have an employer, how do I register with the NHI? At present, you must reside in Taiwan for a consecutive six-month period (or leave only once for less than 30 days) and apply directly with the NHI.</description>

      <description>Can I purchase real-estate? In general, yes, if your country allows Taiwanese nationals to purchase real estate in your country. There are some restrictions, such as not being able to purchase farmland, or land related to a waterway or national defense.
Does my card look any different from other types of ARC? Yes, the entire card is gold in colour. It also has slightly different information such as a different title (R.</description>

      <description>Should I switch from an APRC to a Gold Card? According to NIA officials, no. They stress that this card is nonrenewable and you must go through the application process again toward the end of the gold card. One way of looking at that is that the Foreign Special Professional program could change to the point where one no longer qualifies. APRC is therefore “safer” in the long term.
Consider also if the program doesn’t change.</description>

      <description>Note: Everyone has a different situation. Please consult an accountant before relying on content from this section.
 How do I apply for the tax relief for Foreign Special Professionals? As a Gold Card holder working in Taiwan for the first time, for the portion of your salary over NT $3 million, half of it can be excluded from your effective income for your first three years of residence. eg if your salary was NT $6 million, you only pay tax on NT $4.</description>

      <guid>https://taiwangoldcard.github.io/goldcard.tw/faq/validity/</guid>
      <description>How long is a gold card valid? By default, between one and three years. If you are concerned your card (or underlying visa/work permit) may have become invalid or expired, you can check with the National Immigration Agency.
Can I renew my gold card? No. There is no renewal capability for a Gold Card. You must complete the same application process you went through for your first card for all subsequent cards.</description>
