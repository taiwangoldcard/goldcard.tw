      <description>The Taiwan Employment Gold Card is a combined visa, work permit and residence permit launched in 2018 to attract professional talent in Taiwan. The card gives you the right to stay and work in Taiwan for 1 year to 3 years, and you can apply online without sponsorship. The card comes with open work rights, so you may work for any (or multiple) company in Taiwan or start your own business.</description>

      <description>What do I need to tell my employer about the Gold Card? Your Gold Card is a four-in-one document that contains your work permit, residence visa, reentry permit and Alien Residence Certificate. You have open work rights and they do not need to apply for a work permit or visa for you.
What happens if I lose my job? You may simply find a new job. Your Gold Card is not sponsored by your employer and will not be affected by a change of job.</description>

The most popular property search website is 591. Unlike in some other countries, real estate agents offering rental properties in Taiwan are typically only brokers who present prospective tenants to landlords for a fee and you will normally deal directly with a landlord from lease signing onward.</description>

      <description>Should I switch from an APRC to a Gold Card? According to NIA officials, no. They stress that this card is nonrenewable and you must go through the application process again toward the end of the gold card. One way of looking at that is that the Foreign Special Professional program could change to the point where one no longer qualifies. APRC is therefore ‚Äúsafer‚Äù in the long term.
Consider also if the program doesn‚Äôt change.</description>

      <description>Can my spouse and children come with me if I get a Gold Card? Yes, for children under 20 years old and married spouses this is no problem.
Can my spouse work, if they join me in Taiwan as a dependant? The Gold Card does not provide for a work permit for dependants of the card holder. Your spouse should get their own work permit.

      <description>Since February 2018, when the Gold Card was launched, card holders have been helping people apply and integrate into life in Taiwan. We think that Taiwan is an amazing place to live and work, and encourage you to apply for the Gold Card if you&amp;rsquo;re eligible. An open work permit, tax benefits, ability to bring your family - all applied for online and approved based on your existing skills, no need to already have a job or a company to sponsor you.</description>
