## General Guidelines

Regardless of which bank you choose, you will need to follow the following procedures:

1. Bring your Employment Gold Card and another proof of your identity (passport).

2. Go to a bank near the address stated on your Employment Gold Card. For example, you cannot go to Xinyi to open a bank account if your residential address is at Sanchong.

3. Prepare a local Taiwan number. This is needed for most banks to send OTP for login to your internet banking portal.

The incoming foreign currency fee can be waived once a month if you have 500,000 NTD in the bank account.
